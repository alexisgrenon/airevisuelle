## What is an optician?

The dispensing optician is the professional who carries out the prescription of the optometrist, either in the form of contact lenses or glasses. He is also the one who will proceed to the adjustment of glasses or contact lenses, or even to the learning of contact lenses (getting used to putting them for the first time).

The 3-year training of opticians allows them to be able to advise the client in the choice of his frame, as well as to adjust it for optimal comfort. They are also trained to ensure that your lenses or glasses are adapted to your situation, and to make corrective lenses. They are specialists who will know exactly how to direct you in your choices, and who you can trust completely. Whether with glasses or contact lenses, our opticians will be happy to assist you in choosing your next visual correction!
