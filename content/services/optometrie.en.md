## What is an optometrist?

The Doctor of Optometry is the professional you see for your eye exam. After 5 years of college studies, he obtained his doctorate, and is able to assess ametropia (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia, etc.), eye health, screening for certain eye diseases or any another anomaly. The optometrist may also prescribe certain medications or refer the patient to ophthalmology, and advise the patient on the wearing of contact lenses or corrective surgeries.
